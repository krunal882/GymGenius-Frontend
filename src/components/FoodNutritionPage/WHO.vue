          According to the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO uses its convening
          power to help set, align and advocate for priorities and policies that
          move nutrition forward globally; develops evidence-informed guidance
          based on robust scientific and ethical frameworks; supports the
          adoption of guidance and implementation of effective nutrition
          actions; and monitors and evaluates policy and programme
          implementation and nutrition outcomes. This work is framed by the
          Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant, and young child
          nutrition, adopted by Member States through a World Health Assembly
          resolution in 2012. Actions to end malnutrition are also vital for
          achieving the diet-related targets of the Global action plan for the
          prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, the
          Global strategy for women’s, children’s, and adolescent’s health
          2016–2030, the report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity
          (2016), and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. In May 2018,
          the Health Assembly approved the 13th General Programme of Work
          (GPW13), which guides the work of WHO in 2019–2023. Reduction of
          salt/sodium intake and elimination of industrially produced trans-fats
          from the food supply are identified in GPW13 as part of WHO’s priority
          actions to achieve the aims of ensuring healthy lives and promote
          well-being for all at all ages.</v-card-text
