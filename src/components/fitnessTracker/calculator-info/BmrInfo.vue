    <h2>CALCULATING YOUR BASAL METABOLIC RATE</h2>
    <p>
      It’s easy enough to find a rough estimate of your BMR. Though actual
      amounts will vary according to person - there are too many variables to
      take into account to be 100% accurate all the time - a simple BMR
      calculator will be able to put you in the right ballpark
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can do it yourself using a simple enough equation. This
      is called the Harris-Benedict equation, and it goes like this:
    </p>
    <h5>For Women</h5>
    <p>
      BMR = 655 + (9.6 × weight in kg) + (1.8 × height in cm) – (4.7 × age in
      years)
    </p>
    <h5>For Men</h5>
    <p>
      BMR = 66 + (13.7 × weight in kg) + (5 × height in cm) – (6.8 × age in
      years)
    </p>
    <h2>WHAT DOES BMR TELL YOU ABOUT TDEE?</h2>
    <p>
      YOUR BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR) IS THE CORNERSTONE OF YOUR TOTAL DAILY
      ENERGY EXPENDITURE (TDEE). HERE'S WHAT BMR REVEALS:
    </p>
    <p><ul><li>BMR represents the number of calories your body needs at rest to maintain basic functions.

    </li><li>TDEE accounts for your BMR plus additional calories burned through daily activities and exercise.
    </li><li>BMR provides a baseline for understanding your body's calorie needs, while TDEE factors in the calories you burn through physical activity and lifestyle choices.</li><li>By knowing your BMR and activity level, you can estimate how many calories you should consume daily to maintain, lose, or gain weight.

    </li></ul></p>

    <h2>LIMITATIONS OF THE BMR CALCULATOR</h2>
    <p>While the BMR calculator is a valuable tool, it does have its limitations:</p>
    <h5>SIMPLIFIED ASSUMPTIONS: </h5>
    <p>BMR calculations are based on general population averages and formulas that make assumptions about activity levels and metabolism. Individual variations can be significant.</p>
    <h5>DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR MUSCLE MASS:</h5>
    <p>BMR calculators don't directly consider muscle mass, which can significantly impact your metabolic rate. Muscle burns more calories at rest than fat.</p>
<h5>CHANGING FACTORS: </h5>
<p>Your BMR can change over time due to factors like aging, hormonal changes, and changes in muscle mass. Calculations based on your current data may become less accurate over time.</p>
<h5>NOT A STANDALONE SOLUTION: 
</h5>
<p>The BMR calculator is just one piece of the puzzle. Nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle choices all play crucial roles in achieving your fitness goals.
