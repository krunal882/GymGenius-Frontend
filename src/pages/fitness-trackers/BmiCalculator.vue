        >Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used metric for assessing whether an
        individual's weight is within a healthy range for their height. It is a
        straightforward and useful tool that provides a general idea of whether
        you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on your
        weight and height.<br /><br
